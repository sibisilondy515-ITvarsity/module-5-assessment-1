        <h1> Jupiter</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Jupiter is the closest planet to the sun and due to its proximity it is not easily seen except during twilight.
        </p>             

        <p>
            Jupiter is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just 10km in diameter between the poles and the equator. The average radius of the Sun is 695,508 km (109.2 x that of the Earth) of which 20-25% is the core.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earths were squished inside with no wasted space then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Sun's surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth's.
